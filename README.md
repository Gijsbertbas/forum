# forum
This is a little hobby project using Scrapy and Django to rebuild the message board of 'de Prinsen'.

* 'forumscrape' is the scrapy project to download and store all posts in a database
* 'forumreborn' is the Django project which rebuilds the site
* 'forumillustrations' contains some files to make figures for the 'facts & figures' page

Install the wordcloud package with:
pip install git+git://github.com/Gijsbertbas/word_cloud_transparent.git@master

This is a forked version of the original by Amueller where I added the option of transparency.
